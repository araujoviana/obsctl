# obsctl

A blazingly fast command-line interface (CLI) for managing Huawei Cloud Object Storage Service (OBS) ðŸš€

Its focus is on making common operations as fast and simple as possible. It is not intended to be a feature-rich replacement for the official `obsutil`. For complex workflows, batch operations, or advanced configurations, using the official tool is recommended.

> **Disclaimer:** This is an unofficial, community-driven tool and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or supported by Huawei. For official resources, please refer to the [Huawei Cloud website](https://www.huaweicloud.com/).

## Features

-   **Bucket Management**: Create, list, and delete buckets.
-   **Object Management**: Upload, download, delete, and list objects with human-readable sizes and truncated paths for better display.
-   **Command Aliases**: Use convenient shortcuts for common commands (e.g., `lsb` for `list-buckets`).
-   **(some) Parallel Operations**: Upload or delete multiple objects/buckets concurrently.
-   **Flexible Authentication**: Load credentials from command-line flags, environment variables, or a `credentials.csv` file.
-   **Smart Region Handling**: Automatically uses a default region from environment variables if not specified via CLI.
-   **Progress Bars**: `upload-object` and `download-object` commands now display interactive progress bars.
-   **Note on API Output:** The tool now parses and pretty-prints responses from the OBS API, replacing raw XML output with clear, human-readable formatting.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the Rust toolchain installed. If not, get it from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).

### From Crates.io (Coming Soon)

This tool will be available on `crates.io` soon. Once published, you will be able to install it with:
```bash
cargo install obsctl
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/araujoviana/obsctl.git
cd obsctl
cargo install --path .
```

## Quick Setup

### Using the `setup` command

To get started quickly, run the `setup` command. This will guide you through configuring your Huawei Cloud OBS credentials (Access Key and Secret Key) and a default region. These settings will be saved as environment variables in your shell's profile (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc. on Linux/macOS, or PowerShell profile on Windows) so you don't have to specify them with every command. You can always override these settings using the `--ak`, `--sk`, and `--region` flags.

```bash
obsctl setup
```

### Manual Authentication

`obsctl` loads your Huawei Cloud Access Key (AK) and Secret Key (SK) in the following order of priority:

1.  **Command-line flags** (least secure, use for quick tests only):
    ```bash
    obsctl --region <region> --ak <YOUR_AK> --sk <YOUR_SK> lsb
    ```

2.  **Environment variables** (recommended for general use):
    ```bash
    export HUAWEICLOUD_SDK_AK="YOUR_ACCESS_KEY"
    export HUAWEICLOUD_SDK_SK="YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
    export HUAWEICLOUD_SDK_REGION="your-default-region"
    ```

3.  **`credentials.csv` file**:
    You can get this file from your cloud console or create it yourself. `obsctl` expects the Access Key in the second column and the Secret Key in the third. For example:
    ```csv
    User Name,Access Key Id,Secret Access Key
    your-user,YOUR_ACCESS_KEY,YOUR_SECRET_KEY
    ```

## Usage

The basic command structure is `obsctl [OPTIONS] <COMMAND> [ARGS]`.

**Note on Regions**: You can specify a region using its official code (e.g., `la-south-2`) or by a major city name (e.g., `santiago`). The tool will automatically map the city to its corresponding region code. If you have set a default region using `obsctl setup` or the `HUAWEICLOUD_SDK_REGION` environment variable, you can omit the `--region` flag.

### Examples

**List all buckets:**
```bash
obsctl lsb # Uses default region if set
obsctl --region us-east-3 lsb # Overrides default region
```

**Create a new bucket:**
```bash
obsctl mkb -b my-new-bucket
```

**Upload a local file:** (Object name defaults to filename)
```bash
obsctl put -b my-new-bucket -f ./local/image.png
```

**Upload a file with a custom object path:**
```bash
obsctl put -b my-new-bucket -f ./image.png -o "archive/2025/image.png"
```

**Upload all `.jpg` files in the current directory in parallel:**
```bash
# Note: This behavior may
# differ on Windows (cmd.exe).
obsctl puts -b my-new-bucket -f *.jpg
```

**List objects in a bucket:**
```bash
obsctl ls -b my-new-bucket
```

**Download an object:**
```bash
obsctl get -b my-new-bucket -o "archive/2025/image.png" -d ~/Downloads
```

**Delete an object:**
```bash
obsctl rm -b my-new-bucket -o "archive/2025/image.png"
```
