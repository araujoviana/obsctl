# obsctl

A blazingly fast command-line interface (CLI) for managing Huawei Cloud Object Storage Service (OBS) ðŸš€

Its focus is on making common operations as fast and simple as possible. It is not intended to be a feature-rich replacement for the official `obsutil`. For complex workflows, batch operations, or advanced configurations, using the official tool is recommended.

> **Disclaimer:** This is an unofficial, community-driven tool and is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or supported by Huawei. For official resources, please refer to the [Huawei Cloud website](https://www.huaweicloud.com/).

## Features

-   **Bucket Management**: Create, list, and delete buckets.
-   **Object Management**: Upload, download, and list objects.
-   **Parallel Operations**: Upload or delete multiple objects/buckets concurrently.
-   **Flexible Authentication**: Load credentials from command-line flags, environment variables, or a `credentials.csv` file.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the Rust toolchain installed. If not, get it from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).

> I will upload it to crates.io soon, sorry ðŸ™ƒ

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/obsctl.git
cd obsctl
cargo install --path .
```

## Setup

### Authentication

`obsctl` loads your Huawei Cloud Access Key (AK) and Secret Key (SK) in the following order of priority:

1.  **Command-line flags** (least secure, use for quick tests only):
    ```bash
    obsctl -r <region> --ak <YOUR_AK> --sk <YOUR_SK> lsb
    ```

2.  **Environment variables** (recommended for general use):
    ```bash
    export HUAWEICLOUD_SDK_AK="YOUR_ACCESS_KEY"
    export HUAWEICLOUD_SDK_SK="YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
    ```

3.  **`credentials.csv` file**:
    You can get this file from your cloud console, *OR* you can create a file named `credentials.csv` in the directory where you run the command. The format should be:
    ```csv
    User Name,Access Key Id,Secret Access Key
    your-user,YOUR_ACCESS_KEY,YOUR_SECRET_KEY
    ```

## Usage

The basic command structure is `obsctl -r <region> <COMMAND> [ARGS]`.

### Examples

**List all buckets:**
```bash
obsctl -r us-east-3 lsb
```

**Create a new bucket:**
```bash
obsctl -r us-east-3 mkb -b my-new-bucket
```

**Upload a local file:** (Object name defaults to filename)
```bash
obsctl -r us-east-3 put -b my-new-bucket -f ./local/image.png
```

**Upload a file with a custom object path:**
```bash
obsctl -r us-east-3 put -b my-new-bucket -f ./image.png -o "archive/2025/image.png"
```

**Upload all `.jpg` files in the current directory in parallel:**
```bash
# Your shell (untested on Windows) expands *.jpg into a list of files
obsctl -r us-east-3 puts -b my-new-bucket -f *.jpg
```

**List objects in a bucket:**
```bash
obsctl -r us-east-3 lso -b my-new-bucket
```

**Download an object:**
```bash
obsctl -r us-east-3 get -b my-new-bucket -o "archive/2025/image.png" -d ~/Downloads
```
